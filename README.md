### **README.md**

# **Take a Guess**

## **Overview**
**Take a Guess** is a machine learning project designed to predict stock prices using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network implemented in PyTorch. The project processes historical stock market data and trains a deep learning model to generate future price predictions, helping to analyze trends and forecast market movements.

---

## **Features**
- Processes raw stock market data for training and testing.
- Implements an LSTM-based model for time-series forecasting.
- Supports training, validation, and testing pipelines.
- Includes performance evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE, MAPE).
- Provides a modular structure for data exploration, model analysis, and testing.

## **Installation**
### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### **Steps**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Take_a_Guess.git
   cd Take_a_Guess
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Prepare your dataset:
   - Place raw stock data in the `data/raw/` directory.

## **Usage**
### **1. Data Exploration**
Use the `data_exploration.ipynb` notebook to analyze and visualize the raw dataset. Ensure that the data is clean and ready for preprocessing.

### **2. Training**
Run the `train.py` script to train the LSTM model:
```bash
python src/train.py
```

### **3. Evaluation**
Evaluate the trained model on the test dataset using `evaluate.py`:
```bash
python src/evaluate.py
```

### **4. Predictions**
Make predictions using the `prediction.py` script:
```bash
python src/prediction.py
```

### **5. Model Analysis**
Use the `model_analysis.ipynb` notebook to compare the predicted prices with actual prices and calculate performance metrics.

---

## **Testing**
Run the unit tests to ensure the data loader and model are functioning correctly:
```bash
pytest tests/
```
